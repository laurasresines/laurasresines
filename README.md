BACKROUND

I graduated from the university of Paderborn with a Master of Science in mechanical engineering. So far I have worked as a modelling and simulation engineer and I have found a new passion in data science. I started learning about it to improve my skills and now I am looking for opportunities to put this knowledge into practise. I enjoy improving and optimising technical process that have an application in today's industry. Specially if they help in sustainability matters! 
 
Contact me if I can be of any help
